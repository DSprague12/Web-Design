            <h2>My Family</h2>
            <p>
                I’m not an only child! I have a sister who is weirdly obsessed with playing fetch — like a dog. 
                I’ve told her it’s not very dignified, but she insists. Then there are my two brothers. They still live the outdoor life, 
                climbing trees, patrolling the yard, and coming home covered in leaves and adventure. We’re all different, 
                but we’re all part of the same family.
            </p>
            <p>
                Speaking of the dog… yes, there is a dog in this household. He’s alright. Kind of clueless, a bit drooly, but mostly harmless. 
                I like to bat at him through the bars of his kennel — it’s our little routine. He barks, 
                I swipe, and then we both pretend we’re not enjoying the attention.

            <h2>A Day in the Life</h2>
            <div id="bubble1">
                <p>
                    People always ask what I do all day like I’m not booked and busy!
                </p>

                    I start my mornings with a dramatic stretch, followed by a gourmet breakfast 
                    (okay, it’s kibble, but I act like it’s filet mignon).
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="bubble3">
                <p>
                    Then I patrol the house, making sure everything smells like me, 
                    and maybe sneak in a surprise pounce or two.
                </p>

            <div id="bubble4">
                <p>
                    Afternoons are for napping, often in weird positions that make my humans laugh.

            <div id="bubble5">
                <p>
                    Evenings are when I come alive! That’s when the zoomies hit, and I sprint from room to room like 
                    I’m training for the Cat Olympics.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="bubble6">
                <p>
                    After all that, I curl up with my family, purr like a tiny motorboat, 
                    and demand cuddles -on my terms, of course.
